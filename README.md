You can save money on operating expenses by shutting down the Application Gateway in Azure when it's not needed.

The gateway's ability to start and stop makes better resource management possible.

The Application Gateway can be started and stopped automatically by Azure, and this automation can be scheduled to suit your requirements. 

Consider migrating from a Run As account to Managed Identities for better security and management.
