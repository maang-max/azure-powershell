You can save money on operating expenses by shutting down the Application Gateway when it's not needed. 
Applications or non-production environments where round-the-clock availability is not required will find this especially helpfull.
The gateway's ability to start and stop makes better resource management possible.
The Application Gateway can be started and stopped automatically by Azure, and this automation can be scheduled to suit your requirements. This guarantees that the gateway is only operating when required and minimizes manual intervention.
